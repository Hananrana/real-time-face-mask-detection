# Real-Time Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning
A real-time computer vision system that detects whether a person is wearing a face mask using deep learning and OpenCV.

## Overview

This project implements a real-time face mask detection system using deep learning and computer vision techniques.  
The system detects human faces from live video streams and classifies each face as **Mask** or **No Mask** with confidence scores.

The primary focus of this project is practical deployment, real-time inference performance, and clean system design rather than only model accuracy.
